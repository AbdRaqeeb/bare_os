## Bare OS
This is a simple operating system that can run on [bare metal](https://www.suse.com/suse-defines/definition/bare-metal/) built using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

It is based on the _[ Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/)_ tutorial by [Philipp Oppermann](https://github.com/phil-opp)
